- Implemented basic geometry and shader representation for game objects.
- Designed & Implemented platform-agnostic APIs for mesh and effect that works with both OpenGL and DirectX.
- Developed a Maya plugin to export the 3D objects to the custom engine, streamlining the asset pipeline.
- Created MeshBuilder to build the Mesh files to binary geometry files for efficient loading of the models during runtime.
- Implemented a Lua-based asset build pipeline for the game engine that can be configured to build only the necessary assets during the testing and development of a game

1. Controlling meshes based on Input: a. CTRL-To disappear a mesh b. SPACEBAR-Change color of shader of one of the meshes
